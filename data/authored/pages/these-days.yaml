  <h2>What Justin is up to lately</h2>
  Hey lovely friends.  Justin here.
  
  Most of my life these days is occupied making original bluegrass, acoustic covers of classic video game music, novel threshold cryptograpohy, and ZK tech at <a style="color: #7c47ee" href="https://threshold.network">Threshold Network</a>.

  I'm <a href="/tour.html">on the road</a> much of the time, somtimes in my 36' school bus.
  
  Half the time, my awesome kiddo Fibonacci is with me.
  
  I'm also very much into cycling, local food, quantum mechanics, epidemiology, political science, and a bunch of other topics.
  
  Some of y'all know me by my middle name, "Myles" - please feel free to use that name for me if you met me that way.  
  And if we don't know one another yet, you're always welcome to say hi any time you see me in person.
