Some of the titans of infectious disease research and policy are waged in a dispute about whether "herd immunity", approached in a controlled and informed way, is the next step of humanity's adjustment to the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.

"Try to reach it without a vaccine, and millions will die," reads the lede this morning in a [New York Times opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-herd-immunity.html) entitled, **"What the Proponents of ‘Natural’ Herd Immunity Don’t Say"** by Carl T. Bergstrom and Natalie Dean.  Is their sensationalist approach justified?

Bergstrom is a frequent feature on my Twitter feed, known for his loud and agitating (and often very much welcome) style of questioning scientific findings, as several of my friends and colleagues follow him.  I hadn't heard of Dean prior to this piece, but a cursory look at her website and twitter suggests that she is also thoughtful and reasonable expert. 

Bergstrom and Dean argue that, as we chase herd immunity (they offer a hypothetical scenario in which the threshold is two-thirds of the population, though of course many researchers place it lower; a [preprint paper today](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081893v1) purports to show that it's possibly much lower), more people will become infected than need to be.  "If 100,000 people are infectious at the peak and they each infect 0.9 people, that’s still 90,000 new infections, and more after that," they narrate.  In other words, if I may paraphrase: if there is a critical mass of people who are infected the day that herd immunity is achieved, those people will continue to infect non-immune people (and they, others) for a period afterward (months, they say), meaning that we'll have more infections than were necessary.

"These additional infections are what epidemiologists refer to as 'overshoot'," they say.

Consequently, and as an aside: I have read, I estimate, some 500 epidemiology papers since I picked up the (again, totally amateur and self-driven) study during the ebola outbreak in 2014, and I have never seen this term used this way.  My experience with this term is that it is used to describe the number of susceptibles in a vaccination strategy, such as to measure the likelihood of success of a subsequent strain of a virus, or in regard to regional allocation of vaccines, when one region receives too many at the expense of another.  I had not seen this word used to describe herd immunity arising from infections.

Additionally, the word "overshoot" does not appear in the [Oxford Dictionary of Epidemiology](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195314496.001.0001/acref-9780195314496?btog=chap&hide=true&page=69&pageSize=20&skipEditions=true&sort=titlesort&source=%2F10.1093%2Facref%2F9780195314496.001.0001%2Facref-9780195314496).  Searching for the term on Google Scholar produces, in the first ten pages of results, no scholarly publications using it in the way that the authors do.  An ordinary web search seems to indicate that the term has been used the way the authors use it in discussions of Covid-19, but I cannot find an occurrence of its use in this way prior to these discussions.

My reason for bringing this up is that, as best I can tell, this is a novel (but to be sure, interesting) way to consider natural herd immunity rather than a well-established, documented, and researched phenomenon.  The authors, as far as I can tell, are coining this use of the word (and that's fine - I hope that it is added to the dictionary).  But no case of "overshoot" from history is offered in their piece, and it's not clear how skeptical readers might engage in the study of this phenomenon on which they base their argument.  In other words, it's hard to treat this as a falsifiable hypothesis at this time because this is not something with sound historical research whose consequences we can easily observe from previous pandemics.

With that out of the way, let's take a brief look at some of the particulars.

> Given that current estimates suggest roughly 0.5 percent to 1 percent of all infections are fatal, that means a lot of deaths.

These lower- and upper-bounds, even when considered "roughly", are not in keeping with the best reading of the data in the past four weeks.  It is difficult to understand how these authors can view these numbers as a "given", though I've invited Dr. Bergstrom to debate on reddit, and I am happy to have my mind changed, as I do respect him greatly and look forward to his book coming in August.  I hope he responds to my invite.

Their link for this statement is an [article from the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/antibody-tests-support-whats-been-obvious-covid-19-is-much-more-lethal-than-flu/2020/04/28/2fc215d8-87f7-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html), which, simply put, does not contain or support this assertion.  It does reference the 0.56% IFR found [by a New York study](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-statewide-antibody-testing-survey-will) (quoting Cuomo calling it .5).  Including probable Covid-19 deaths puts the IFR as high as .8% in New York.  These numbers are outliers in the available studies, but if the authors had chosen .8% as their upper-bound, there is a way to defend it in the context of this single study and this particular reading of the data.  However, I am not aware of any expert who, at this time, is still talking about an IFR of 1% that the authors here state as the upper-bound of their "given" range.

The .5% lower bound of their range is also indefensible at this time, as nearly every serological study has concluded that the IFR is lower.  These are conducted by different scientists around the world of their respective regions, all showing IFRs lower than the lower bound purported without a proper source in this editorial: [Miami](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article242260406.html?fbclid=IwAR2svgTSw4gmNvTrCl35bG1lYQtmqkMXOc4Sre_92zLdJx1Uyr1T6FeaR2U), [San Miguel, CO](https://www.sanmiguelcountyco.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=511&fbclid=IwAR3XfQkv1OCSuOY-w1FkDCu0BDGnG07yf-D9_Ilne_Bd8oYAnJ80S6w2QZU), [Boston](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/coronavirus-boston-homeless-testing?fbclid=IwAR0Ai5luXYXKOGLB8Y-znlk0yXakg5Q_R_mowEV1bU8AGt15VaC2a99Ft7g), [Helsinki, Finland](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/-/number-of-people-with-coronavirus-infections-may-be-dozens-of-times-higher-than-the-number-of-confirmed-cases?fbclid=IwAR3bDYNRIQBQFxhJdrmjypoHtbk_thqb5E_ayR9IUU3FUGeXrP3oc6GwpS0), [Denmark](https://www.sst.dk/-/media/Udgivelser/2020/Corona/Status-og-strategi/COVID19_Status-6-uge.ashx?la=da&hash=6819E71BFEAAB5ACA55BD6161F38B75F1EB05999&fbclid=IwAR0yF9-CVqtvldch1wRB0d2esxDwzH-rjv3XRJq62Qt1WWAkR48BIMauvbI), [Iceland](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2006100), and just today, from [Kobe, Japan](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20079822v1.full.pdf) and [Iran](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.26.20079244v1).  

In any case, even if all of these surveys are incorrect and the IFR is as high as .5%, there are obvious steps we can (and we will) take to ensure that far fewer than 1 out of 200 people who contract Covid-19 during the immunity acquisition phase will die.

The main tool here is risk stratification by age.  As a 38-year-old male in good health, I belong to a profile with a [level of risk of death that is difficult to distinguish from my risk of death in the absence of the virus](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054361v1).  I will happily be exposed at the first opportunity (this assumes I haven't already been).

On the other hand, my grandmother (whose experiences and perspectives I consider frequently, and with great effort) is in a very different profile; she needs to refrain from sharing indoor spaces with strangers until after herd immunity is reached (and any subsequent "overshoot" has concluded).  Tangentially, she tells me that she is having mental health issues due to both the lockdown and the hysteria and has stayed in her house for the past two months, which of course is neither good for her individual risk of mortality nor her quality of life.

Nobody, and certainly none of the experts who opine for more restraint on the use of mandatory lockdowns, advocate an approach which ignores stratification of risk.  A Google Scholar search for "covid-19 risk stratification" yields dozens of resources on precisely this topic.  There are plenty of video and print interviews as well, from experts like [Katz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK0Wtjh3HVA), [Osterholm](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/), [Atlas](https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/494034-the-data-are-in-stop-the-panic-and-end-the-total-isolation), and [Wittkowsi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0Q4naYOYDw&feature=youtu.be) (the last of whom I hadn't heard of prior to Covid-19, but who comes across as a deeply concerned, if absent-minded, expert watching his profession and his science being misunderstood and misapplied).  Being a topic of such high availability, it's difficult to understand why the authors chose to ignore it in their calculus.

The only mention of what is, after all, the cornerstone of the strategy described by the expert commentary which these authors seek to counter is this: 

> Some countries are attempting strategies intended to “safely” build up population immunity to the coronavirus without a vaccine. Sweden, for instance, is asking older people and those with underlying health issues to self-quarantine but is keeping many schools, restaurants and bars open. Many commentators have suggested that this would also be a good policy for poorer countries like India. But given the fatality rate, there is no way to do this without huge numbers of casualties — and indeed, Sweden has already seen far more deaths than its neighbors.

Tallying the total number of deaths by or with SARS-CoV-2 yields a metric of very little value at this middle stage if your concern is saving lives and quality of life.  Much more important is the number of deaths per progression.  If Sweden is much further along in the course of the virus, of course they have experienced more hospitalizations and deaths due directly to the disease.  But have they experienced more in proportion to the progress?  When Norway and Finland are at the same stage of progress, will they have similar numbers of deaths then?  If so, then at that point, the lives saved from refraining from lockdowns will be a net win on the top.

Simply put, this piece is unconvincing.  It raises an alarm which it does not support with any actual data.  It ignores or sidesteps the core arguments being made by expert advocates of controlled herd immunity.  If this is the best argument against herd immunity, there is no argument against it.
