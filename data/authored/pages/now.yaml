  What I'm up to now
  ==================

  I live in Portland, OR.

  I engage in daily research into cryptological science and other physical and social sciences.  I ride my bike quite a lot.  I write lots of Python (and Javascript, and prose, and whatever) for myself, my family, and a few really cool clients.

  Currently, I'm engaged in full-time participation with [NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/), building byzantine-fault-tolerant threshold cryptography.
