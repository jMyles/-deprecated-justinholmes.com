  ### I program.  I travel.  I teach.  I invent.

  But I don't strive to be a programmer, traveler, teacher, or inventor.

  My aim is to be a good and curious person - to make the people around me more free, to teach myself a bit of science and social studies each day, and to make a more peaceful and just world for my kid's generation.

  ### How did I get into programming and engineering?

  By the time I finished my degree in **political science** in 2008,
  it was obvious that **the code** that directed the state (ie, **the law**)
  was followed only **irregularly** and **unpredictably**.

  By contrast, the machines of the information age have no choice but to execute **the laws** of their world: **the code we give them**.

  I decided straight-away to transition to more "hard sciences" learning in order to be **the change I wanted to see in the world**
  via **software and hardware engineering and research** rather than (or at least in addition to)
  trying to elect officials or persuade those already elected.
